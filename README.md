Project Description
Netflix has consistently seen growth in its subscriptions. This project aims to:

Analyze subscription trends over different time periods.
Train and evaluate a Linear Regression model to forecast future subscription numbers.
Provide data-driven insights to understand subscription growth patterns.
Dataset
The dataset contains subscription data for Netflix, including:

Time periods (e.g., quarters or years)
Total number of subscribers
Quarterly or annual growth rates
Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Features were engineered to derive meaningful insights.

Key Features
Subscription Trend Analysis: Visualization of subscriber growth trends over time.
Growth Rate Calculation: Analysis of quarterly and annual growth rates.
Forecasting: Predicting future subscription numbers using a trained Linear Regression model.
Visualization: Dynamic and static visualizations to communicate insights.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly
Machine Learning: Linear Regression
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-subscriptions-forecasting.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd netflix-subscriptions-forecasting
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Future Improvements
Use more complex machine learning models for better forecasting accuracy.
Incorporate external factors (e.g., market trends, competition) into the model.
Develop a dashboard for real-time forecasting and visualization.
Conclusion
The Netflix Subscription Forecasting project was a comprehensive analysis aimed at understanding and predicting Netflix's subscription trends. By leveraging historical data and applying machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, we were able to achieve meaningful insights into subscription growth and future trends.
