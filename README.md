Netflix Subscription Forecasting and Analysis
1. Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's historical subscriber growth and offers future forecasts using statistical modeling and machine learning. By examining trends from 2013 to 2023, the project aims to identify key growth patterns and predict subscriber numbers for the coming quarters.

2. Dataset
The dataset utilized contains Netflix's quarterly subscriber data over a 10-year period. It is a time-series dataset with two primary columns:

Time Period: Represents the quarter and year of the data entry.

Subscribers: The total number of subscribers for that specific time period.

3. Methodology
A. Data Preprocessing & Exploration
Data Cleaning: The initial data is loaded and checked for missing values and correct data types.

Trend Visualization: Interactive line and bar charts are generated using Plotly to visualize the overall subscriber growth and the quarterly growth rates.

Key Metrics Calculation: The total growth and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) are calculated to provide a clear, long-term performance overview.

B. Forecasting Models
ARIMA Model: An ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is used to forecast future subscriber numbers. The model's parameters are identified by analyzing the differenced time series using ACF and PACF plots.

Linear Regression Model: A simpler, trend-based forecasting approach is implemented using a Linear Regression model. The Time Period is used as a feature to predict the Subscribers count.

4. Key Findings
Growth Trends: The analysis reveals a general upward trend in subscriber numbers, with notable fluctuations in the quarterly growth rate over time.

Model Predictions: Both the ARIMA and Linear Regression models provide valuable predictions for future subscriber growth, which can be compared to assess their respective strengths in capturing the underlying trends.

5. Technologies & Libraries
Python: The core language for the project.

Pandas & NumPy: Used for efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.

Plotly & Matplotlib: Employed to create a variety of informative visualizations, from static plots to interactive charts.

statsmodels: The primary library for implementing the ARIMA time-series forecasting model.

scikit-learn: Used for developing and evaluating the Linear Regression model.

6. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how historical time-series data can be leveraged to forecast future business performance. The combined use of exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling provides a robust framework for understanding and predicting Netflix's subscriber growth.
